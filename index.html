<h1> My Cookie Clicker Success </h1>
<h2> Starting Out </h2>
<p> This is the game Cookie Clicker. It was produced in Java by a French programmer known as Ortiel, and has gained popularity over the years. What I do is play it. </p>

<p> Yes, I play Cookie Clicker for a living. How that even works, I don't know. But I do know that I get a paycheck in the mail every month, so I'm not complaining. </p>

<p> Once I found this game, I was in love. It's so simple and fun! I'm pretty much addicted at this point. I mean, as of 9/13/16, 8:04 am, I make 884,400.5 cookies per SECOND. </p>
